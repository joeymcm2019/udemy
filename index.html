    <p>I graduated a while back but I didn't really know where I should put my focus in the field.
        However, I was fortunate enough to be able to pursue my other passions during the recent years. I have
        worked when needed but otherwise, I have been all about soccer, golf, gaming, faith, friends & family.
        I've made some really good friends and made a lot of good memories. My favorite memories would be going
        to Rome and Mexico with friends, and funny family get togethers. Recently, my cousin Ben, also a
        computer scientist, advised that I should look into learning react, as it is a highly employable skill.
        I've been following his advice and it has led me to a conclusion: I want to work as a full-stack web
        developer. And fortunately, I found a great tool to get me started. I finished a course I
        found on Udemy which had everything I was looking to learn in order to be able to use React. In the near 
        future I hope I find myself a good job as a web developer. I look forward to having an exciting career 
        and seeing where it takes me.
