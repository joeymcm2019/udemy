    <h2>Chapter 1: HTML Basics </h2>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. The language relies on tags and content within those tags.
        For example: the following line uses the h1 tag. <br> &lt;h1> Hi there!&lt;\h1> <br>
        This tag is used for creating headers on pages. Tags like this one have a beginning tag
        and an end tag (&lt;h1>, &lt;\h1> respectively). Some tags are self closing tags, meaning one should not use
        a close tag with these sort of tags. For example, &lt;br> creates a new line on the page, and requires no
        closing tag. This makes sense, since a line break doesn't really have a beginning and end. The
        computer just does it.
        However, the computer needs to know when headers are finished, or really any tag which includes
        content or is modifying content (eg. center). We have to tell the computer when we're done.
        <br><br>
        The next piece to know about tags is that some of them have attributes. The header tags, for
        example, have the attribute allign, and can be utilized as follows: <br>
        &lth1 align="center">Hello World!&lt/h1> <br>

        This creates the header, "Hello World", and centers it on the page. Attributes are useful for
        adding customizations to elements, thereby aiding in creating a certain page style and format.
        <br>
        The examples here are quite limited; whereas the amount of tags and attributes needs to know in
        order to create an appealing site are quite numerous. Fortunately, there are useful resources on the
        web that make finding pertinen information much easier than trying to memorize it all. The following
        sites are quite handy for finding whatever one needs when coding a webpage. I'm liking devdocs a lot
        so far. I can find whatever I'm looking for by simply typing in the key term. Nice and fast.
        If all else fails, google has my back. Have to get that thrill of efficiency :)

    <h2>Side Note</h2>
    <p>
        Evidently, choosing which tag to use isn't as simple as one may think. When it comes to choosing the
        correct tag for text content, for example, don't assume that just because your tag does what you want,
        that it is actually accomplishing what you want. The tag i and the tag em both make their content
        italisized but em is actually what tells browsers that the information is stressed. There is a
        semantic difference.
        See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em" target="_blank">
            i vs em.</a>
        The tag strong vs the tag b is another example. Both make the text bold, but their semantics are
        different.
    </p>
    <h2>More Info</h2>
    <p>
        &lt;ul> is used for unordered lists. In other words, bullet points. &lt;ol>, similarly, is used for
        ordered lists. Then, for ul you use style="list-style-type:_____" and fill the blank with whatever
        attribute you'd like (circle,disc,or
        square). For ol you use type and or start.
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol" target="_blank">
            See Docoumentation (ol).
        </a>
        Within the ul or ol, use &lt;li> to create list elements (bullet points).
        <br><br>
        <Strong>Example</Strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Tables</h3>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>Table Structure
            <br>
            &lt;table>
            <br>
            &lt;tr>
            <!--Table Row Creation-->
            <br>
            &lt;td>cell info&lt;/td>
            <!--Table Data/Column Creation-->
            <br>
            &lt;td>cell info&lt;/td>
            <!--Column Two Info-->
            <br>
            &lt;/tr>
            <!--End Table Row-->
            <br>
            &lt;/table>
            <!--End Table-->
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The tag table creates the table. The tag tr creates a table row. The tag td creates a table cell/column.
        This is where one puts content into their table. You can create as many rows and columns as you like.
        First useful attribute I've learned about for tables is cellpadding which puts however much space one wants
        between all the elements in the table.

    </p>


    <h3>Forms</h3>
    <p>
        We probably wouldn't get very far without forms, because forms allow us to take input from the user.
        And of course, the vast majority of websites do this, for text inputs that is.
        <br>
        Creating forms is quite simple. Just use the tag form. Haven't learned much about its attributes yet
        but for now we'll use the method attribute and set it to post.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Label:</strong> this tag puts text on our page which we can use to label form elements such as
        a text box.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Input:</strong> this tag can create an input space for the user, for text, or a click box, or
        other types of inputs. The type atrribute for this tag has many possibilities.
        See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input" target="_blank">MDN</a>
        <br>

        <strong>Example</strong>

    <form class="form1" method="post">
        <label>Your Name</label></td>
        <input type="text" name="" value=""></td>
        <input type="submit">
    </form><br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Code</strong> <br><br>
        &lt;form class="" method="post"> <br>
        &lt;label>Your Name &lt;/label> &lt;/td> <br>
        &lt;input type="text" name="" value=""> &lt;/td> <br>
        &lt;input type="submit"> <br>
        &lt;/form> <br><br>

    <h3>Background Color</h3>
    <p>
        Background color for a page can be quite easily changed by inserting a line of code into
        the body tag. <br><br>
        style="background-color: #e5effe;" <br><br>
        For nice color choices, see
        <a href="https://colorhunt.co/?adlt=strict&toWww=1&redig=C669E57367854361BCBA922DAE1CF766" target="_blank">Color

    </p>



    <h3>Styling all tags in a file with one go</h3>

    <p>
        Use the style tag to make modifications to all tags of your choice throughout your file. For example,
        you can change all the hr tags at once, or all the table tags at once. Just use the style tag to make
        the modifications you want to see for each instance of these elements.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Example:</strong><br><br>
        &lt;style> <br>
        hr { <br>
        height: 3px; <br>
        background-color: #000000; <br>
        border-style: none; <br>
        } <br>
        &lt;/style> <br><br>

        This changes any hr tags (that don't have these attributes specified) in your file to have
        these attribute specifications. No more rewriting the same code over and over again. All
        hr tags in this file will have these attributes. All you have to is write &lthr> and your done!
        Good time saver!

        <br><br>
        <strong>Corollary</strong><br><br>

        Implementing such changes across all pages of a site is the next step. And it's simple! One simply needs
        to create a css file where they will store these stylings. Then, in the header section of each page, one
        simply adds the folling line: <br><br>

        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css"><br><br>

        As you can see I used a folder called css, and my css file was styles.css. Using this line in each page I have
        ensures that each page will implement the same stylings that I have chosen. This makes it much easier
        to make changes across the entire site. Quite nice!

        <br><br>
        <strong>CSS Syntax</strong><br><br>
        Once inside the css document, the following syntax is used to modify whatever elements one would like.
        <br><br>

        selector { property: value; }

        <br><br>

        Selector: what tag do you want to modify? <br>
        property: what attribute do you want to modify from the tag? <br>
        value: how do you want to modify the attribute? <br><br>
        Pretty simple!

        <br><br>
        Finding the selector is probably going to be the easy part. But finding the right property that will change
        what you want--that might not be so easy sometimes. So, MDN here we come: <br><br>

        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference?adlt=strict&toWww=1&redig=51791ED79FE446ACB9FB88735ADA87DE"
            target="_blank">Properties</a><br><br>

        <strong>The class and id selectors</strong><br><br>
        Want to use different settings on the same tag? For example, want your h1 to be blue sometimes but other times
        have it be red? It's quite simple! But, BE WARNED! The id selector can only be used once per page! The class
        selector, on the other hand, can be used to modify as many tags as you want! See examples below for how
        to set these up:
        <br><br>

        class example: <br> &lt;h1 class="blueHeader"> <br>
        id example: <br> &lt;h1 id="blueHeader"> <br><br>

        These lines make it so this h1 will follow the CSS stylings set up for the class blueHeader. Now all we have
        to do is add a little code to our style.css. Note the dot before the class label and the # before the
        id label. This is important!!
        See below: <br><br>

        class example: <br>

        .blueHeader { (DON'T FORGET THE DOT!!)<br>
        background-color: "blue"; <br>
        } <br><br>

        id example: <br>

        #blueHeader { (DON'T FORGET THE #!!)<br>
        background-color: "blue"; <br>
        } <br><br>


        We can do the same thing for a redHeader by repeating the process. Pretty handy! Note:
        the class and id selectors are more specific than tag selectors, meaning they have higher
        precedence.<br><br>

        <strong>Multple Class Selection</strong><br><br>
        To apply multiple classes to a tag, simply add a space and another class name within the
        class selector. See below: <br><br>

        &lt;h1 class="blueHeader bigFont"> <br><br>

        <strong>NOTE:</strong> you cannot have multiple id selectors for a tag. <br><br>

        <strong>Psuedo Classes</strong><br><br>
        Psuedo Classes are used when you want to affect an element when it's in a different state. Yes,
        elements have different states. For example, when a user <strong><em>hovers</em></strong> over an
        element with their mouse, this puts that element in a different state. Thus, html has a hover state.
        See example below for how to use:
        <br><br>

        In our style.css:<br>
        img:hover { <br>
        background-color: "orange"; <br>
        } <br><br>

        This code will make it so whenever we hover over an img element, it will change its background color to orange.
        <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3>Div element</h3>

    <p>
        The div element is useful for creating display blocks. One can <em>divide</em> the page into sections using
        these, so to speak. The default setting is take up the whole width of the page, but this can be edited.
        <br><br>
    </p>



    <h3>Box model</h3>
    <p>
        One can look at html elements as boxes. Each of these boxes has certain properties that are useful to
        know and that one can change to create the design one desires. See below:
        <br><br>
        <img src="images/boxModel.jpg">
        <br><br>
        The blue section in the middle is the content. It has a height and width. Then there's the padding, border, and
        margin properties. Each of these properties has a top, bottom, left, and right value.
        <br><br>
        <strong>padding:</strong> space between content and the border of the container element (div, for example).
        Padding increases the size of the container element. This is because it expands the space around the content
        area. The content area is just the defualt size of the container.
        <br><br>
        <strong>border:</strong> space around container. This adds to the total size of the container. For example,
        if a container is 100px wide but has a 20px border, its total width will be 140px (20px border-left + 20px
        border-right).
        <br><br>
        <strong>margin:</strong> space between container and next level container. If the page itself is the next level
        container, then you get space between the outside of the page.
        <br><br>
        <strong>example:</strong>
        <br><br>
    </p>
    <div id="divEx">
        <p id="boxP">Content inside 100px div box with 20px solid border and 40px padding and 20px margin</p>
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <p>
        <strong>div code</strong><br><br>
        width:100px; <br>
        height:100px; <br>
        background-color: yellow; <br>
        display: flex; <br>
        justify-content:center; <br>
        border: 20px solid; <br>
        padding: 40px; <br>
        margin: 20px; <br><br>

        <strong>paragraph code</strong><br><br>

        <br>
        align-self:center; <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3>Display</h3>
    <p>
        Four of the main values for display: block, inline, inline-block, none. <br><br>

        <strong>block:</strong> these elements go across the whole page horizontally. Thus, they block out
        other content from being on the same line. Examples include <em>paragraph, div, headers, etc.</em> Note
        that even though you can change these elements width, they still block out other elements from being
        on the same line. That is, unless you change their display property value.
        <br><br>

        <strong>inline:</strong> these elements can be placed on the same line as other inline elements.
        Examples include <em>images, and span.</em> Note: height and width are not respected, though
        padding and margin are.
        <br><br>

        <strong>inline-block:</strong> you can set the width and height of these elements and they be on the same line
        as other inline or inline-block elements.<br><br>

        <strong>none:</strong> the element will not be displayed and will not take up any space. <br><br>

        <strong>Example of block, inline, & inline-block: </strong>
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_inline-block_span1"
            target="_blank">w3schools</a>
        <br></br>
    </p>

    <h3>CSS positioning</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Three Default Rules:</strong><br><br>
        1. Content effects box models. For example, a large font makes its content box larger. Note, this
        is different than its container. If a paragraph is in a div, for example, the size of the paragraph does not
        effect size of div. But the font size, and size of paragraph does effect the size of its own content box.
        <br><br>
        2. The order of the content comes from the order of the code. Plain and simple.
        <br><br>
        3. Children sit on top of their parents. If a paragraph is within a div, it sits on top of the div element.
        If a span is within a paragraph, it sits on (within) the paragraph.
        <br><br>
    </p>

    <h4>Four Position Properties</h4>
    <p>
        1. Static: default html setting for all elements. Keep to default html flow<br><br>
        2. Relative: positions an element relative to default position using top,
        bottom, left, and right values/coordinates. Note left actually moves the element right,
        and vice versa. Top moves element down, bottom moves element up.
        <strong>NOTE: <em> this doesn't effect the position of anything else on screen, </em></strong>
        as if the element was still in its <em><strong>original position.</strong></em>
        <br><br>
        3. Absolute: positions an element relative to its parent. The right value distances an element from the right
        ending side of its parent. The left its left. The top its top. The bottom its bottom. Essentially adds
        a margin to the parent element. <strong>NOTE: </strong>absolute positioning <strong><em>affects html flow.</em>
        </strong> The element is <strong><em>no longer </em></strong>apart of the natural flow of the document. It's as
        if the element doesn't exist to the rest of the page.
        <br><br>
        4. Fixed: positions an element relative to the page, keeping its position the same regardless of scrolling.
        Useful for nav bar. Top, bottom, left right work the same as with absolute positioning.
        <br><br>
    </p>


    <h3>Centering Elements</h3>
    <p>
        Use <strong>text-align: center</strong> within the parent class to center text elements within the
        parent element. I like this method the most for centering text. The other way is to use
        <strong>margin: 0 auto</strong> for the text element. This sets the margin for the top & bottom to 0, while
        setting the margins for left and right automatically, and such that the text is centered.
         <strong>Note:</strong> The problem with this is that it centers the text based on the width of text element rather than the text
        itself. Therefore, it's less accurate. You can use relative positioning, however, to help with this. You can also
        use the center tag to horizontally center any elements you wish. I think this is a pretty good method.
        You can also use <strong>vertical-align: center</strong> to center an element. I need to test this one more.

        More useful positioning attributes:<br><br>
        <strong>float: </strong> value can either be set to left or right. Takes the next element and puts it on the same line. Useful for "floating" text next to an image. <br><br>
